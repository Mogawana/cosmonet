## Predicting the Ellipticity of galaxies Utilizing CNN
This is a Tutorial on how to use cnn to predict the ellipticity of given images of galaxies. 

### Dependence
- python, numpy, matplotlib
- Theano, Lasagne
- CUDA7.5, cuDNN

### Basic Steps
- Generate a set of images as training set
- Create a CNN
- Train the CNN using the simulated images
- Input simulated images to the trained model for testing
